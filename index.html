                <h2>Do Cats Know Their Name?</h2>
                <p>Cats are very intelligent pets and it is well known that they are able to identify sounds and patterns
                    with ease. Consider their excitement when they hear their food being poured into a bowl! They are well aware that 
                    that certain sounds mean certain events will occur. Often times however cats may prefer to ignore our calls to them, as 
                    they can go through their solitary moods.
                </p>

                <h2>Essential Tips to Raise a Healthy Feline</h2>
                <p>The age-old question: "How do I care for my cat?". 
                    When you adopt a new cat always ask for as much information as possible from the breeder or pet shop.
                    It is essential to keep your cats breed, genetics, and temperment in mind when you are in the beginning 
                    stages of adoption. Some breeds such as ragdoll cats are generally known to be laid back and gentle, however 
                    they often suffer with skin conditions and matting in their fur. Short hair cats dont have this issue.
                    The genetics of your new cat will tell you everything you need to know in the beginning stages.

              <h2>Why Does My Cat Bite Me?</h2>
              <p>Although cats have been domesticated for many many years, there are some aspects
                of the wild feline nature that have yet to subside. Cats have a natural instinct to hunt,
                often times their playful nature can trigger a hunting mindset. This is why your cat will occasionally switch 
                from a playful gentle scenario, into less of an enjoyable situation for you. You can attempt to 
                discourage this behaviour by giving your cat a stern: "no!", or by spritzing a small amount of water onto your cats back.
                Only do this when your cat is displaying harmful or unsavory behaviours.
              </p>

            <h2>How To Throw Your Cat A Birthday Party!</h2>
            <p>Have you ever thought to yourself: "How do I throw my cat the best birthday party ever?!". 
                If you have, we're on the same train of thought! Consider everything your cat loves and holds dear,
                perhaps a new toy, some lovely cat treats, or even a new cat tower! The possibilities are endless!
                The best thing you can give you cat overall, is your love and attention.

            <h2>Jack & Jessie's Story:</h2>
            <p>On December 24th, 2018 all Jessie wanted for Christmas was a kitten.
                All she could think about was a new best friend to call her own.
                After a long day of christmas shopping Jessie and her mom arrived at home.
                Jessie and her mom were making dinner preparations for their family the following
                day. 
                <br><br>
                Jessie had begged her mom for a kitten, but it did not seem to work. Jessie's mom
                had never owned a cat before and was wary to get one.
                The next morning Jessie and her mom awoke and began to prepare breakfast.
                Jessie heard a faint sound coming from the front door. When she went to open it 
                she couldnt see anything. Jessie heard the sound again and peered into the 
                shrubs next to the door, only to find...a kitten!
                <br><br>
                Jessie quickly scooped up the small black kitten and brought him inside.
                The kitten was freezing, this worried Jessie so she promptly wrapped him in a blanket.
                Jessie's mom quickly came to adore him and the two of them were determined to nurse him back to health.
                <br><br>
                Jessie's mom made a small joke saying: "He's so cold, it's as though Jack Frost himself was after him". 
                The small black kitten eventually made a full recovery and has been affectionately named "Jack" In reference
                to his first night with Jessie and her mom.
